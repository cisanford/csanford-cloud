<meta name="description" content="Solving problems that involve people using computers
I believe that organizations thrive when we all acknowledge two fundamental truths about software engineering:

Computers always and exclusively do what they are told
People are not computers

I have experience helping optimize around both of those concepts.
Professional Background
I have about a decade of experience with support, operations, architecture, and engineering in AWS.

My LinkedIn is here. Send me a message!
If you&rsquo;re into certifications, my Credly wallet is here.
My Github profile is here, if you really want, but be advised that due to work-life balance virtually all my code contributions happen on company-owned organizations.

Artificially expanding my commit history and codebase is on the roadmap




Professional philosophy
My experience in Big Tech, Little Tech, and parenting has led me to the following tenets of IT leadership:">

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Venting&rdquo; is a legitimate thing to do, but most of what tech workers call &ldquo;venting&rdquo; is often non-constructive gossip.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t say anything on Slack you don&rsquo;t want someone to selectively screenshot and send to the entire company.</li>
<li>Complaining is fine, but try to keep it results-driven.</li>

<li>If you&rsquo;re spending more time planning a project than you would waste by not doing that planning, stop planning and go make some mistakes.</li>

<h3 id="professional-sabbath">Professional Sabbath<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#professional-sabbath">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Giving an engineer one Friday a month off to focus on recreation and self-actualization pays for itself and then some.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="calendar-conflicts-mean-things">Calendar conflicts mean things<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#calendar-conflicts-mean-things">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t invite people to meetings &ldquo;optionally, for awareness&rdquo;; if they are optional, they can get sufficient awareness from an after-meeting summary (or nothing at all).</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t find a time that works for everyone, you might be inviting too many people.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="utilitarian-project-management">Utilitarian Project Management<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#utilitarian-project-management">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Analysis paralysis happens. While you&rsquo;re busy deciding what to do next, deliver a feature to kill time.</li>
<li>Something that reduces customer pain is better than nothing; Busy work is worse than nothing.</li>

<li>If you&rsquo;re able to get away with not paying attention, you probably don&rsquo;t need to be there. Just decline the invite and keep working.</li>

<h3 id="bus-factor-awareness">Bus Factor Awareness<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#bus-factor-awareness">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you feel like you can&rsquo;t take a vacation or sick day because &ldquo;the team needs you&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re generating a business risk.
<ul>
<li>Delegate more work, transfer more knowledge, or decline more requests.</li>

<ul>
<li>Engineers are going to implement solutions in search of problems out of ambition and curiosity anyway; it can be more effective to just assign tickets for pet projects that may go nowhere rather than bloating your code base when someone hunting a promotion turns your kubectl manifest into the next Uber.</li>
