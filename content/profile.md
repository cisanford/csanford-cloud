# Solving problems that involve people using computers

![it's good weather for ducks](/images/seattle.png)

I believe that organizations thrive when we all acknowledge two fundamental truths about software engineering:
- Computers always and exclusively do what they are told
- People are not computers

*Exceptions to the above usually indicate the subject is malfunctioning.*

I have experience helping optimize around both of those concepts.

## Professional Philosophy

My experience in Big Tech, Little Tech, and parenting has led me to the following tenets of IT leadership:

### Avoid echo chambers
- "Venting" is a legitimate thing to do, but most of what tech workers call "venting" is often non-constructive gossip.
- Don't say anything on Slack you don't want someone to selectively screenshot and send to the entire company.
- Complaining is fine, but try to keep it results-driven.

### Get off the pot
- If you're spending more time planning a project than you would waste by not doing that planning, stop planning and go make some mistakes.

### Professional sabbath
- Giving an engineer one Friday a month off to focus on recreation and self-actualization pays for itself and then some.

### Calendar conflicts mean things
- Don't invite people to meetings "optionally, for awareness"; if they are optional, they can get sufficient awareness from an after-meeting summary (or nothing at all).
- If you can't find a time that works for everyone, you might be inviting too many people.

### Utilitarian project management
- Analysis paralysis happens. While you're busy deciding what to do next, deliver a feature to kill time.
- Something that reduces customer pain is better than nothing; Busy work is worse than nothing.

### Zoom call multitasking
- If you're able to get away with not paying attention, you probably don't need to be there. Just decline the invite and keep working.

### Bus factor awareness
- If you feel like you can't take a vacation or sick day because "the team needs you", you're generating a business risk.
  - Delegate more work, transfer more knowledge, or decline more requests.

### Resume driven development
- Engineers are going to implement solutions in search of problems out of ambition and curiosity anyway; it can be more effective to just assign tickets for pet projects that may go nowhere rather than bloating your code base when someone hunting a promotion turns your kubectl manifest into the next Uber.

### When everything is a P0, nothing is
- We all feel personally attacked at this one
