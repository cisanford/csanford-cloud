## The actual passion project

This resource is very near and dear to my heart, and I'm really excited to share it with you.

I'll come back and dress up this page a bit later with all the delightful images and formatting we love, but I really wanted to publish this before opening day (Tomorrow!!!), and I've only got about 20 minutes to get the change done. I hope that people who need this before tomorrow get their hands on it.

I love baseball. A lot. I love the stats, the history, a cold beer on a hot day (or, in Seattle's case, a very cold night), the scream of the crowd during a close play at the plate. It's like nothing else.

My dad and I travel to a different ballpark each summer to follow God's Chosen Team, the Colorado Rockies, to an away game. The first year we did this, we went to Dodger Stadium, where our $50 Chavez Ravine parking came with a game program and scorebook. I very clearly remember my voice jumping up an octave when I asked my dad, "Do you want to keep score?"

I've done it almost every game since.

Every so often, I look at scorecards I fill out and I compare them to scorecards from a hundred years ago, and they look more or less the same. There's just this little slice of immortality to the practice.

But then comes the math. I really loved the [Eephus League Halfliner](https://eephusleague.com/product/the-halfliner/) (indeed, I still do, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good scorebook), but its box score didn't have strikeouts on the hitter's column. That bothered me enough I set out to design my own.

After three years of painstakingly drawing, re-drawing, and play testing designs, I settled on this one as "good enough" to print out in a full 81-page notebook. I used [Mixam](https://mixam.com/) for that job, since they seemed to be the most effective at printing large spiral-bound books, but it's just as good to swing by a Kinko's on your way to the ballpark and print one page out from the PDF.

You can download the resources [on my GitHub](https://github.com/cisanford/baseball) for now, and I'll host them here later when I come back to pretty up the page.
