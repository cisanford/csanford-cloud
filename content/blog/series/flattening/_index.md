## Where `for` art thou romeo

![Scrolling code thumbnail](./feature-thumb.gif)

In this series, I'll break down a more obvious version of the sample usage for `flatten` included in the [HCL documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/flatten#flattening-nested-structures-for-for_each), expanding each concept into chunks you can understand without a ton of trial and error.

We'll break this up into three parts:
1) How `for` works in Terraform
2) What `flatten` is all about
3) Some real life use cases: AWS security group rules, and GCP IAM role membership

Now that we have a plan, let's get started!
