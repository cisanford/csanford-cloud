## Professional Philosophy

My experience in Big Tech, Little Tech, and parenting has led me to the following tenets of IT leadership (in alphabetical order):

### Avoid echo chambers
- "Venting" is legitimate, but lots of venting in tech is not results-driven.
- Don't say anything on Slack you don't want someone to selectively screenshot and send to the entire company.

### Bus factor awareness
- If you feel like you can't take a vacation or sick day because "the team needs you", you're generating a business risk.

### Calendar conflicts mean things
- Don't invite people to meetings "optionally, for awareness"; if they are optional, they can get sufficient awareness from an after-meeting summary (or nothing at all).
- If you can't find a time that works for everyone, you might be inviting too many people.

### Get off the pot
- If you're spending more time planning a project than you would waste by not doing that planning, stop planning and go make some mistakes.

### Professional sabbath
- Giving an engineer one Friday a month off to focus on recreation and self-actualization pays for itself and then some.

### Utilitarian project management
- Analysis paralysis happens. While you're busy deciding what to do next, deliver a feature to kill time.
- Something that reduces customer pain is better than nothing; Busy work is worse than nothing.

### Resume driven development
- Engineers are going to implement solutions in search of problems out of ambition and curiosity anyway; it can be more effective to just assign tickets for pet projects that may go nowhere rather than bloating your code base when someone hunting a promotion turns your kubectl manifest into the next Uber.

### Zoom call multitasking
- If you're able to get away with not paying attention, you probably don't need to be there. Just decline the invite and keep working.

### When everything is a P0, nothing is
- We all feel personally attacked at this one
